Ever since Unreal Engine first unveils Control Rig for UE4.23, it has opened up more possibilities to enhance your animations in Unreal Engine. However, like quite a few of things in Unreal Engine, it has yet been documented well by Epic Games. This compendium aims to fill the gap and hopefully giving better understanding on what Control Rig is

# Introduction

Control Rig is a {scriptable system} in Unreal Engine that allows for 

A somewhat common misconception with Control Rig is that it allows for making skeletal meshes from scratch inside the editor. This is untrue. **Control Rig does not facilitate creating weighted skeletal meshes from the ground up.** 

This compendium is intended to guide you through the basics of Control Rig and how you can use them to either enhance your animation graph or making animations from scratch. While the screenshots are taken from a modified source build of UE5.1, I do not make any engine level modification into the animation tools, so this compendium should be applicable to both vanilla launcher builds (the one you get from the Epic Games Launcer) and the source build of UE5.

This compendium assumes you already have understanding of following things:
- Basics of 3D animation and the general workflow
- Basics of the Unreal Editor and its animation workflow and ecosystem
