Welcome to the SUPER SECRET page for my social medias! This is mainly a specialized "about" page for my social media accounts targeted towards English speaking audience, similar to carrd.co pages that kids these days use, and is not meant for reference in professional setting.

This is largely redundant for Japanese and Korean audience, since this is less of an issue.

## Before You Follow (BYF)

Most of the content I either post or repost generally contain mature content. Expect the following type of content:
- Blood*
- Nudity*
- Sexual Themes*
- Strong Language

<span style="font-size: 12px;">
*only applied to fictional characters
</span>

## Do Not Interact (DNI)

Do not interact if you are:
- politically charged, including but not limited to:
    - supporting DEI virtue signaling
    - supporting double standard hate speech
- unable to behave like a functioning adult
    - mental condition is not an excuse to be a jerk
- unable to separate fiction from reality
